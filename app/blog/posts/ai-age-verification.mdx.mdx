AI Age Verification streamlines online age checks using AI, providing fast and secure access control for age-restricted platforms.

## Goals and Challenges

- Provide reliable age verification using AI  
- Ensure quick and seamless user experience  
- Maintain privacy and security standards  

## Approach

I implemented AI-based age estimation, created a minimal interface in React, and prototyped flows in Framer to ensure smooth user experience.

## Tech Stack and Tools

- Figma for interface design  
- Framer for prototypes  
- React / Next.js  
- AI models for age estimation  

## Outcome and Learnings

The project demonstrated that AI can reliably assist in online age verification, and highlighted the need to handle edge cases gracefully to maintain UX trust.
