As a full-stack design & development project, **GenGlow** was born out of a vision to empower users with personalized beauty insights using AI.

### 🎯 Goals & Challenge

- Create a sleek and intuitive UI that feels welcoming and trustworthy  
- Ensure the AI integration feels seamless and not overwhelming  
- Deliver high performance and responsiveness across devices  

---

### 💡 Approach

Starting from wireframes in Figma, I designed a user journey focused on ease: onboarding, skin condition input, AI-suggested routines, progress tracking. Then, I migrated the design into Framer, building custom interactions and UI states. The key was to balance aesthetics with function: animations needed to be subtle so as not to distract from content.

### 🧰 Tech Stack & Tools

- Figma (wireframing & visual design)  
- Framer (prototyping & UI)  
- React / Next.js (for production build)  
- CSS Modules / Tailwind (styling)  
- Some lightweight AI API integration  

---

### ✔️ Outcome & Learnings

The final result is a polished, responsive web app that delivers fast, smooth transitions. Through user testing, I realized the importance of simplifying onboarding steps — even minor friction in the user flow led to drop-offs.  

I also optimized image and asset loading to reduce perceived latency, which improved the Core Web Vitals scores.
